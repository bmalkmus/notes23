Interactive Note Taker
## Description
Here is a creation of an interactive note taking application using Express npm and a completed front-end application template. Once the JSON package is installed, run the index.js file through the node terminal to set up the server. From there, open up your browser of choice and type in localhost:2323 as the URL. This opens up the application. In the application, you have access to enter and type in any note of your choice. Clicking the save icon in the top right corner of your viewing window will save the note to your notes file. All your notes are viewable to the left of the screen. Clicking on these notes will activate the note in the notes viewing window. Clicking trash can item will delete the note.
